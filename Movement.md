# Movement in Ragnarok Online

This article is a stub, and as such currently very incomplete.

## Movement Speed

Movement speeds are given in the unit of "milliseconds taken to move to the next adjacent tile" (i.e., a distance of one world unit).

This should be interpreted as "delay after moving to the next  ground tile", since movement happens instantaneously:

> On aegis you move to the target cell instantly, then animate the movement where emulators you animate first and arrive second)

### Examples

Red Plant: 2000 (immobile, but glitches can cause it to move... extremely slowly)

Pupa: 1000 (immobile, but glitches can cause it to move... very slowly)

Zombie: 400 (moves slowly)

Osiris: 100 (it's pretty darn fast)

Treasure Boxes: 0 (cannot move at all)

Most creatures appear to be between 150 and 400ms.

It's unclear if player movement is subject to technical limitations (needs more research).
